===========
To develop an AI-powered lead management system for automating responses to Yelp inquiries and nurturing leads through multiple touchpoints, we need to break down the problem into modular components, each focusing on a specific aspect of lead management. This includes:

    Extracting Yelp Leads from Email Notifications
    Automating Browser Navigation to Capture Screenshots of Leads
    Generating AI Responses via Claude 3.5
    Sending Responses to Yelp or Creating HubSpot Tasks
    Logging Lead Data and Automating Follow-Ups in HubSpot
    Lead Nurturing and Multi-Channel Transition

We can leverage several tools and APIs for this process, including Claude 3.5 for AI responses, Zapier or Make for workflow automation, HubSpot for CRM, and browser automation tools like Selenium for capturing screenshots. Below is the Python code that integrates all of these functionalities.
Prerequisites

    Claude 3.5 API: You need access to the Claude 3.5 API for generating responses.
    Zapier or Make: Use to automate the workflow.
    HubSpot API: For logging leads and managing follow-ups.
    Browser Automation (e.g., Selenium): To capture screenshots from Yelp.

Step-by-Step Python Code Implementation

First, you need to install the following dependencies:

pip install requests selenium pyhubspot email-parser

1. Extract Leads from Incoming Emails

We can parse incoming emails from a Gmail inbox using the email library or an API like Gmail API.

import email
from email import policy
from email.parser import BytesParser

def parse_email(raw_email):
    msg = BytesParser(policy=policy.default).parsebytes(raw_email)
    subject = msg['subject']
    from_email = msg['from']
    body = msg.get_body(preferencelist=('plain')).get_payload()
    
    # Extract specific fields: Name, Event Type, Event Date, Lead Source, and Inquiry Message
    # This can be done using regex or manual parsing if email format is fixed.
    # Example: (Regex patterns would depend on the email content structure)
    
    return {
        'name': 'Extracted Name from Body or Subject',
        'event_type': 'Event Type',
        'event_date': 'Event Date',
        'lead_source': 'Yelp',
        'inquiry_message': body
    }

This code assumes you will pass in a raw email, and the function will extract details like Name, Event Type, Event Date, Lead Source, and Inquiry Message from the email content.
2. Capture Screenshot of Yelp Lead

Use Selenium to open Yelp, search for the lead, and take a screenshot.

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import time

def capture_yelp_screenshot(lead_name):
    options = Options()
    options.headless = True  # Run in headless mode (without opening a browser window)
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
    
    try:
        driver.get("https://www.yelp.com/")  # Open Yelp
        search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "find_desc")  # Search bar on Yelp
        
        # Search for the lead using the extracted name
        search_box.send_keys(lead_name)
        search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
        
        time.sleep(3)  # Wait for page to load
        
        # Assuming lead's details appear at the top of the results
        lead_details = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//*[contains(text(), '{}')]".format(lead_name))
        
        # Capture screenshot of the lead details
        screenshot_path = f"./lead_screenshots/{lead_name}_screenshot.png"
        lead_details.screenshot(screenshot_path)
        
        return screenshot_path
    finally:
        driver.quit()

3. Generate AI Response via Claude 3.5

To generate an AI response using Claude 3.5, you’ll need an API integration. Below is a sample function using a generic API request to Claude 3.5. You need to replace API_URL with the actual API endpoint and configure API authentication.

import requests

def generate_ai_response(lead_details):
    api_url = "https://api.athena.ai/v1/claude/response"  # Replace with actual API URL
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"}
    payload = {
        'name': lead_details['name'],
        'event_type': lead_details['event_type'],
        'event_date': lead_details['event_date'],
        'inquiry_message': lead_details['inquiry_message'],
        'templates': ['weddings', 'corporate events', 'private parties'],
        'instructions': 'Generate a professional response based on the above details.'
    }
    
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get('response')
    else:
        raise Exception("Error generating AI response")

4. Send Response via Yelp or HubSpot Task Creation

If direct messaging via Yelp is possible, you can integrate with Yelp's API. Otherwise, we can create a HubSpot task for manual review.

from pyhubspot import HubSpot

def create_hubspot_task(lead_details, ai_response):
    client = HubSpot(api_key="your-hubspot-api-key")
    
    task = {
        "properties": {
            "subject": f"Follow-up for {lead_details['name']}",
            "status": "NOT_STARTED",
            "priority": "HIGH",
            "description": f"Response: {ai_response}",
            "due_date": "2023-09-01T12:00:00",  # You can set it dynamically
        }
    }
    
    client.crm.tasks.basic_api.create(task)

5. Log Lead Data and Automate Follow-Ups in HubSpot

After processing the lead, log data in HubSpot and automate follow-ups.

import time

def log_lead_and_automate_followup(lead_details, ai_response, event_date):
    client = HubSpot(api_key="your-hubspot-api-key")
    
    # Log the lead in HubSpot CRM
    lead_data = {
        'properties': {
            'firstname': lead_details['name'],
            'event_type': lead_details['event_type'],
            'event_date': event_date,
            'inquiry_message': lead_details['inquiry_message'],
            'response': ai_response
        }
    }
    
    client.crm.contacts.basic_api.create(lead_data)
    
    # Schedule follow-up messages
    follow_up_times = [
        24 * 60 * 60,  # 1 day
        48 * 60 * 60,  # 2 days
        96 * 60 * 60   # 4 days
    ]
    
    for delay in follow_up_times:
        time.sleep(delay)
        # Trigger follow-up email (e.g., using HubSpot workflow or external service)
        # You can also use Zapier to trigger an email from HubSpot.

6. Lead Nurturing and Multi-Channel Transition

To transition leads to multiple channels, you can use Zapier or Make to trigger workflows based on lead engagement, such as sending follow-up emails, SMS, or phone calls.

You can use the HubSpot API or Twilio API for SMS, or email services like SendGrid to send follow-ups.
